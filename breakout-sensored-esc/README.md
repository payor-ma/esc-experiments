# breakout-sensored-esc

Circuit schematics, sample code and demonstration media for a 3 phase driver bridge with hall effect sensor feedback.  The purpose of this is to breakout the driving hardware of an ESC so that the controller can be replaced with whatever you want, for the sake of developing and testing.  I've used it with an FPGA and an arduino.
